# Emberoverflow-sk

This repo is the result of reading 'Ambitious Ember Applications - A Comprehensive Ember.js Tutorial' by Ruslan Yakhyaev and building the app as instructed in said book.

This particular repo uses the [Ember Starter Kit](https://github.com/emberjs/starter-kit) to build the app. The same app built with Ember-cli can be found [here](https://github.com/camskene/emberoverflow-cli).
